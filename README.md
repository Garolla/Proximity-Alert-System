# Proximity-Alert-System
Project of the "Operating Systems for Embedded Systems" course at Politecnico di Torino, academic year 2015/2016.
The idea was to implement a proximity alert system using a board (FRDM-k64f), an ultrasonic sensor (HC-SR04 module) e the Micrium uC operating system.
The most file interestang file is the "app.c" but i suggest you to read the "Assignment.pdf" file in order to understand the expected behaviour of the microcontroller.
